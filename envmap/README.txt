RESOURCES USED:

Lecture slides and recordings
three js documentations
opengl math formula documentations.


FURTHER COMMENTS:

For the creative comment, I used a different texture map, added a perputation of light source based on time, more 
specifically moving the light source along the x axis to simulate passage of time. Updated the noise code to reduce 
the frequency of the noises, and used similar strategy in envmap to simulate a puddle effect.


BRIEF ASSIGNMENT SELF-ASSESSMENT:
  e.g.,  I learned x, y, and z.  I struggled with a, b, and c.
  I learned how to pass in time to the shader
  I learned how to create mirror like effects of textures
  I learned how light source interact with the object in a mathmatical sense

  I struggled with aligning the 6 sides perfectly and figuring out the relationship between u, v and x,y,z
  I struggled with how to pass time into the shader code
